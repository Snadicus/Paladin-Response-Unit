# Paladin-Response-Unit
A science fiction/horror Bitsy game where you explore the Space Hulk Artemis as a super soldier known as a Paladin Assault Unit 08.

You are a Paladin, a super soldier created by the space-faring empire of Terris. You have one purpose... to destroy all alien threats that confront Terris!
While exploring space, your team, Paladin Response Unit 443-556, has encountered an S.O.S. signal from a research Space Hulk known as Artimes.
Your team, after contacting Terris High Command, has been authorized to board and destroy any threat.
Things take a twist for the worse, however, as the docking procedure fails. You are the only soldier to have made it into Artimes and escaped the embrace of space.
All alone, with a damaged suit and no weapons, you must now scout Artimes to make way for backup. Good luck, Paladin!

Made with Bitsy for UCF's DIG 4715 'Game Production' course.
